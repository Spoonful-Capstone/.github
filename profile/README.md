# Spoonful Capstone Projects
Spoonful is A revolutionary food coach application, designed to simplify the process of recognizing and understanding the nutritional content of meals.
Spoonful connects people with the most suitable nearby restaurants, and ensure that everyone, everywhere, has access to healthy food.This is a repository 
for our Capstone Projects on Studi Independen Bangkit 2024.

## Get Started
There are three implementation parts of this project: Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Mobile Development.

### Machine Learning
To predict food images, we used the Indonesian Food Dataset from Roboflow and fine-tuned the Inception V2 model using TensorFlow. You can got to 
[Spoonful-ML Repository](https://github.com/Spoonful-Capstone/Spoonful-ML) to look for the details.

### Cloud Computing
We use Google Cloud's Cloud Run to deploy our Express.js and FastAPI applications. Our data is managed with a PostgreSQL database on CloudSQL. 
We store our machine learning model in Cloud Storage. To find the nearest restaurant, we use the Google Maps API for accurate location services.
You can go to [Spoonful-API Repository](https://github.com/Spoonful-Capstone/Spoonful-API) to look for the details.

### Mobile Development
And Last, Mobile implementation ensures optimal functionality and accessibility of our applications. We utilize tools such as Figma, 
Android Studio, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and various dependencies, including retrofit, for this project. You can go to 
[Spoonful-UI Repository](https://github.com/Spoonful-Capstone/ui) to look for the details.
